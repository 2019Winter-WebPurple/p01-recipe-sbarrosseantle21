        <!-- This is an ordered (numbered) list -->
        <ol> 
            <li> Set your alarm clock way too early, because you actually want to cook something to get your day started right. </li> 
            <li> Press snooze a minimum of three times. </li>     
            <li> Wake up in a panic, and ONLY brush your teeth and wash your face. If you have time for makeup and hair, then you didn't press snooze enough times. </li>
            <li> Stumble into the kitchen in a sleepy haze, and make yourself a large coffee in a to-go mug. Then, stand around the kitchen while you wait five minutes for your (sightly broken) Kuerig to make your coffee.</li>
            <li> Realize that making coffee now made you late (its worth it, I'm a monster when I am uncaffeinated), and grab a Kirkland brand granola bar from the pantry and sprint out the door without a coat.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p> Prep-time: 5-10 minutes.</p>
        
        <p> This recipe is perfect for especially weekdays, but can definatly be served on the weekends. It is commonly acompanied by minor sleep deprivation and a hatred for mornings/waking up.</p>
